# Scheduler

## Description

I wanted to create a simple daily planner that shows the current date, and color codes the hour blocks as my workday progresses. I wanted to be able to save entries so that they remained upon refreshing the page. This is a great first step in building a more complete calendar and scheduling page. I learned how to better manipulate arrays going in and out of local storage, and relished the opportunity to practice using jQuery.
